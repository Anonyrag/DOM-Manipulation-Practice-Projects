# **DOM Manipulation – Practice Projects**

This repository contains a collection of **small JavaScript DOM projects** created while learning how to interact with the **Document Object Model (DOM)**.

These projects focus on connecting JavaScript logic with real user interactions such as button clicks, keyboard input, and dynamic content updates in the browser.

The goal of this repository is **concept mastery**, not visual polish.

---

## 📚 What This Repository Focuses On

These exercises are designed to practice:

* Selecting elements using `document.querySelector`
* Updating text and HTML dynamically
* Handling button click events
* Handling keyboard events (Enter key)
* Reading input values
* Applying and removing CSS classes
* Writing simple, interactive UI behavior

This repository bridges the gap between **pure JavaScript logic** and **interactive web applications**.

## 🧪 Projects Overview

### 🔹 Subscribe Button (V1 → V2)

**Files:**

*
*

What it demonstrates:

* Button click handling
* Toggling text content (`Subscribe` ↔ `Subscribed`)
* DOM element selection
* Class manipulation for visual state changes

Learning progression:

* V1 introduces basic DOM interaction
* V2 adds styling and class-based state management

---

### 🔹 Amazon Shipping Calculator (V1 → V2)

**Files:**

*
*

What it demonstrates:

* Reading values from input fields
* Converting string input to numbers
* Conditional logic based on user input
* Keyboard event handling (`Enter` key)
* Updating output dynamically in the DOM

Learning progression:

* V1 focuses on logic and DOM updates
* V2 improves UI styling while keeping logic intact

---

### 🔹 Greeting Projects (DOM Input Handling)

**Files:**

*
*

What they demonstrate:

* Capturing user input
* Handling both button clicks and keyboard events
* Dynamically displaying personalized messages
* Understanding input → output flow in the DOM

These files reinforce the idea that **user input drives UI state**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:

* Practice DOM manipulation fundamentals
* Understand how JavaScript controls the browser UI
* Learn event-driven programming
* Build confidence before larger frontend projects

All advanced projects (games, apps, calculators) rely heavily on these same patterns.

---

## 🎓 Educational Value

This repository is useful for:

* Beginners learning frontend JavaScript
* Anyone struggling with DOM concepts
* Revisiting event handling and UI updates
* Teaching how JavaScript and HTML work together

Each file is intentionally small and focused on **one core idea**.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open any `.html` file in a browser
3. Interact with buttons and inputs
4. Open DevTools (Console) to observe behavior

No libraries, frameworks, or setup required.

---

## 🚧 Notes

* Inline scripts are used intentionally for learning clarity
* Code favors readability over abstraction
* Styling is minimal unless required for state visibility

This repository reflects a **learning stage**, not production patterns.
